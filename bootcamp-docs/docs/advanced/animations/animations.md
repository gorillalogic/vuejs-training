# Animations

Vue.js has built-in `<transition />` and `<transition-group />` components that provide access to CSS and JavaScript hooks.

## Transtions vs Animations

Just to clarify, Transitions and Animations differ, a `Transition` essencially works interpolating the values from a state to another.

Hence `Animations` are very different, you are able to make that multiple states happen within a declaration.

In other words, for projects with less complexity or very small ones, transitions are the right path. On the other hand, for larger apps with high complexity, you should use animations.
