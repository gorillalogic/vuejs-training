# Build

This process is intended for Vue.js applications created via [CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/).

## Complete the follow steps:

1. Generate the dist folder.

```bash
# build
npm run build

# a dist folder is generated
```

2. For static content you can upload the /dist content for example to a [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) Bucket.
